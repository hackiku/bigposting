Summary
🧠 Project Overview:

We are looking for a creative and conversion-focused designer to completely redesign two key pages on our platform:

For Publishers: https://www.bigposting.com/home/publishers
For Advertisers: https://www.bigposting.com/home/advertisers

These pages are currently live but far from their full potential. They need to be visually engaging, highly informative, and optimized for Google Ads traffic and conversions.

Our platform — Bigposting.com
— connects publishers and advertisers for guest posts and link insertions. We operate a growing marketplace that helps publishers monetize their sites and advertisers get quality backlinks.

🎯 Objectives:

We want the new pages to:

Clearly explain the value proposition for both publishers and advertisers

Increase sign-ups and order conversions from paid traffic (Google Ads)

Highlight our unique features using clear visuals, screenshots, and examples

Feel modern, trustworthy, and data-driven, with visual appeal matching top SaaS or marketplace platforms

🖼️ What You’ll Do:

Research our current site and competitors, including:

Adsy.com – Marketers Page https://adsy.com/marketers
Getlinko.com – Advertisers Page https://getlinko.com/en/2-advertisers/

Redesign the two landing pages with a clean, modern, and high-conversion layout

Integrate infographics, diagrams, backend screenshots, and feature flow visuals

Suggest copy improvements or structure for stronger messaging (we can assist with final texts)

Deliver desktop + mobile mockups (Figma or Adobe XD preferred)

Ensure mockups are easy to implement in Next.js / Vercel / Supabase environments

💡 Inspiration & Content Ideas:

We expect to include:

Process diagrams showing how Bigposting works for advertisers and publishers

Dashboard screenshots or snippets showing real metrics (orders, DR, traffic, etc.)

Infographics for pricing, workflows, and escrow system

Visual emphasis on security, automation, and ease of use

Testimonials or case studies

Strong, clear calls-to-action leading to signup or login

🧩 Deliverables:

Two complete page redesign mockups (“For Publishers” and “For Advertisers”)

Responsive design (desktop + mobile)

Exported assets and organized Figma/Adobe XD file ready for developers

Optional: short handoff documentation for the developer team

💼 Ideal Candidate:

Proven experience designing high-converting SaaS / B2B / marketplace landing pages

Strong sense of visual hierarchy and storytelling

Ability to combine real data, UX flow, and visual design

Portfolio with similar work is a must

Experience with Next.js-based projects is a plus

💰 Budget:

Open to proposals — quality and expertise matter more than the lowest bid.
We are looking for a long-term design partner for future pages and updates if the collaboration works well.

🚀 How to Apply:

Please include:

A short note on how you would approach this redesign

At least 3 relevant landing page examples or mockups you’ve created

Your estimated timeline and budget

Tools you use (Figma, XD, etc.)
