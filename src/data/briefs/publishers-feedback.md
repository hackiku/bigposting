Hello, I was able to only review the "publishers" page and here is my feedback

🧭 Bigposting – “For Publishers” Page Redesign Feedback Summary

URL (mockup under review):
https://bigposting-ivan.vercel.app/home/publishers

Goal:
Create a modern, conversion-focused landing page that convinces website owners to register and list their sites on Bigposting.

# 🔧 GENERAL IMPRESSION

The mockup is clean and structurally sound, but it still feels generic and misses several trust-building and conversion elements.
We need stronger visuals, updated styling, and copy that emphasizes the benefit of earning money by publishing guest posts.

🔍 SPECIFIC CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS
🟩 1. Hero Section

Headline:
Change to something more benefit-driven, e.g.

“Monetize Your Website – Get Paid for Every Guest Post”
or
“Turn Your Blog Into an Income Source with Bigposting”

Subheadline:
Add one short line explaining the process:

“List your site, set your price, and receive verified guest post orders.”

CTA Button:

Text should be “List your website for Free” (fix grammar).

Replace orange/golden buttons with a modern, clean color — consider Bigposting green (#7BE65A) or a gradient (green/blue).


Use rounded buttons, subtle shadow, and hover animation.

Visual:
Add a screenshot of the publisher dashboard or “Add Website” form inside a laptop mockup, similar to https://getlinko.com/en/3-editors/
.
This helps people visualize the product immediately.



# 🟩 2. Social Proof Section

Remove fake metrics like “6,000+ websites” or “$2M earned” — these are dynamic and may quickly become inaccurate.

Replace the 4 placeholder logos with new generic/fake logos (simple flat SVGs or realistic dummy logos) that still fit visually.

Add a short subtext like:

“Trusted by website owners across home, tech, business, and lifestyle niches.”

🟩 3. “How It Works” Section

Keep the step-by-step layout but add icons or numbers (1-2-3-4).

Replace the current descriptions with shorter, clearer actions:
1️⃣ Add your website
2️⃣ Get verified
3️⃣ Receive guest post orders
4️⃣ Withdraw your earnings

Add a note below:

“Verified websites get priority in search results and faster approval.”

Include real screenshots of:

“Add website” form
Verification process
“My Orders” view
(show them inside a browser window or laptop mockup for realism)

🟩 4. Publisher Requirements

Reintroduce a Publisher Requirements section (missing in mockup).
Example content:

✅ You must own or manage the website.
✅ Original content, no AI-generated or spun text.
✅ No casino, adult, or illegal content.
✅ Clear pricing and TAT required.

Display it as a clean checklist block with green check icons.

🟩 5. “Why Join Bigposting” Section

Replace generic bullets with benefit-focused points:

Earn up to 91% of each sale (only 9% platform fee).

Verified sites appear higher in search results.

Fast payouts via PayPal.

No negotiation, no spam — only verified advertisers.

Add small icons for visual clarity.



Add a short testimonial or review card (can be fictional for now):



“Bigposting helped me monetize my blogs effortlessly. Orders arrived in the first week!” — Emma R., Lifestyle Blogger



🟩 6. Listing Preview Section



The black-border website listing preview is currently too wide.



Narrow it down for large screens.



Add some background color or subtle shadow to make listings stand out visually.



Label it clearly:



“Your website will appear like this in the marketplace.”



🟩 7. Monetization Emphasis



Add a highlighted section or banner:



“Own a website? Start earning by publishing guest posts today.”
This should appear above the footer or near the CTA to reinforce the main message.



🟩 8. General Design & Grammar



Ensure consistent spelling of Bigposting (not “BigPosting”).



Use consistent button and heading styles.



Improve spacing between sections (more white space).



Add hover effects for buttons and icons.



Keep typography modern — e.g., Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans.



⚙️ SUMMARY FOR DEVELOPER



✅ Replace old button colors and styles with modern palette
